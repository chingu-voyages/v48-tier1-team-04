## Overview

Chingu Voyage 47 is a six-week project where a team of seven individuals, including a user experience designer and a product owner, developed a web application for organizing and managing daily tasks effectively.

### The Project

The Minimum Viable Product of this application allows users to create tasks, assign them a date, priority, frequency, and track their completion. Users can also delete or update tasks. The team was provided with a dataset, which was parsed and displayed in an interface that allows users to sort by category, activity type, and individual tasks.

This project provided an opportunity for the team to gain hands-on experience in web development and work with multi-dimensional datasets. It served as a practical application to hone their skills and delve into the complexities of data manipulation within a web-based environment.
