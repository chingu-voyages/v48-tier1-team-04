    "reason": "We did not have a designer on board for this project so we began with a very simple design. We used a color palette of green, white, and black to create a clean and easy-to-read interface. The font used is 'Lato' which is a clean and modern typeface that is easy to read on screens. The layout is simple and straightforward, with a focus on usability and accessibility. The wireframe below shows the basic structure of the page, with a header, search bar, dinosaur list, diet chart, and detailed information section. The goal was to create a user-friendly interface that allows visitors to quickly find and access information about dinosaurs. It features a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes, making it accessible on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. I also sprung to purchase some really neat water-color dinosaur images to add a bit of fun to the site.",

    "challenge": "In this Voyage I learned what it was like to work with a real Scrum Master and Product Owner. I learned how to work with a team of developers and how to communicate effectively with them. I learned how to use the Scrum framework to manage the project and how to prioritize tasks and set goals. I also was able to take to time to teach others how to use tools like GitHub to collaborate with the team and track our progress. Overall, it was a valuable experience that taught me a lot about working in a team and managing a project. I also learned a lot about dinosaurs, which was a fun bonus! The biggest challenge that we faced was not having a dedicated designer on the team. ",
    "solution": "We overcame this challenge by keeping the design simple and focusing on usability. We used a clean and modern color palette, a legible font, and a straightforward layout to create an interface that is easy to navigate and understand. We also purchased some water-color dinosaur images to add visual interest to the site. By working closely with the team and communicating effectively, we were able to create a functional and informative SPA that meets the needs of our target audience. We also used the Scrum framework to manage the project and prioritize tasks, which helped us stay on track and meet our goals. Overall, the project was a success, and we are proud of what we accomplished together. In the end I implemented a design from another project and tweaked it to work with our project. I do wish I had done this sooner as it would have been a great learning experience for the others."
